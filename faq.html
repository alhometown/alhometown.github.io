        <div class="faqh2">
            <h2>WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE CAN BE QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS THAT COME ALONG WITH UNDERSTANDING OUR BUSINESS MODEL, SO WE'VE GATHERED A LIST OF COMMON QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE ASKED US, ALONG WITH OUR ANSWERS! IF YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS, PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO CONTACT US HERE,  OR GIVE US A CALL AT 205-914-4215 AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY REMAINING QUESTIONS YOU STILL HAVE!</h2>

        <div class="questions">
            <h3>Q: WILL YOU BE LISTING MY HOUSE ON THE MLS OR ACTUALLY BUYING IT?</h3>
            <p>A: GREAT QUESTION! WE'RE NOT AGENTS, AND WE DON'T LIST HOUSES. WE ARE PROFESSIONAL HOME BUYERS: WE BUY HOUSES THAT MEET OUR CRITERIA, AND FROM THERE WE MAY REPAIR THE HOUSE AND RESELL IT, OR KEEP IT AS A RENTAL OURSELVES.</p><br>
            <h3>Q: DO YOU PAY FAIR PRICES FOR PROPERTIES?</h3>
            <p>A: MANY OF THE HOUSES WE PURCHASE ARE BELOW MARKET VALUE (WE DO THIS SO WE CAN RESELL IT AT A PROFIT TO  ANOTHER HOMEOWNER). AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE ARE LOOKING TO GET A FAIR DISCOUNT ON A PROPERTY. HOWEVER, IN OUR EXPERIENCE, MANY SELLERS AREN'T NECESSARILY EXPECTING A LARGE "WINDFALL" ON THE PROPERTY, BUT RATHER APPRECIATE THAT WE CAN OFFER CASH, CLOSE VERY QUICKLY, ALONG WITH NO TIME/EFFORT/EXPENSE REQUIRED ON THEIR PART TO FIX UP THE PROPERTY OR PAY AGENT FEES. IF THAT'S THE TYPE OF SERVICE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. OUR NO-OBLIGATION PRICING COMMITMENT MEANS THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE OFFER WE GIVE - SO WHY NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE AND SEE IF OUR OFFER IS UP TO YOUR STANDARDS?</p><br>
            <h3>Q: HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THE PRICE TO OFFER ON MY HOME?</h3>
            <p>A: OUR PROCESS IS THANKFULLY VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD! WE LOOK AT THE LOCATION OF THE PROPERTY, WHAT REPAIRS ARE NEEDED, THE CURRENT CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY, AND VALUES OF COMPARABLE HOMES SOLD IN THE AREA RECENTLY. IN SHORT - WE TAKE MANY PIECES OF INFORMATION INTO CONSIDERATION AND COME UP WITH A FAIR PRICE THAT WORKS FOR US, AND WORKS FOR YOU TOO!</p><br>
            <h3>Q: ARE THER ANY FEES OR COMMISSIONS TO WORK WITH YOU?</h3>
            <p>A: THIS IS ANOTHER REASON THAT MAKES US STAND OUT FROM THE TRADITIONAL METHOD OF SELLING YOUR HOME: THERE ARE NO FEES WHEN YOU SELL YOUR HOME TO US. WE'LL MAKE YOU AN OFFER, AND IF IT'S A FIT THEN WE WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROCESS OF BUYING YOUR HOME (AND WE'LL COVER THOSE PESKY CLOSING FEES). NO HASSLE, NO FEES, NO STRESS. WE MAKE OUR MONEY AFTER WE PAY FOR REPAIRS ON THE HOME (IF ANY) AND SELL IT FOR A PROFIT - WHICH IS OUR BIGGEST RISK WE TAKE. WE NEVER KNOW IF WE WILL PROFIT FROM YOUR HOME OR NOT! THAT DOESN'T STOP US FROM BUYING IT, THOUGH! WE TAKE THE SAME CHANCE ON OURSELVES AS YOU TAKE ON US, AND HOPE IT PAYS OFF IN THE END. IF NOT, WE'RE JUST HAPPY WE COULD HELP SOMEONE WITH THE QUICK SALE OF THEIR HOME.</p><br>
            <h3>Q: HOW ARE YOU DIFFERENT FROM A REAL ESTATE AGENT?</h3>
            <p>A: REAL ESTATE AGENTS LIST PROPERTIES AND HOPE SOMEONE WILL BUY THEM. THE AGENT SHOWS THE PROPERTIES TO PROSPECTIVE BUYERS (IF THERE ARE ANY - THE AVERAGE TIME TO SELL A PROPERTY IN MANY MARKETS RIGHT NOW IS ANYWHERE FROM 6-12+ MONTHS) AND THEN TAKE A PERCENTAGE OF THE SALE PRICE IF THEY FIND A BUYER. OFTENTIMES, THE AGEN'TS COMMISSION IS 3-6% OF THE SALE PRICE OF YOUR HOUSE. AGENTS PROVIDE A GREAT SERVICE TO THOSE THAT CAN WAIT TO SELL, AND DON'T MIND GIVING UP SOME OF THAT SALE PRICE TO PAY FOR COMMISSIONS. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE DIFFERENT': WE'RE NOT AGENTS, WE ARE HOME BUYERS. WE BUY HOMES - NOT TIME, COMMISSION, AND PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS. HOWEVER, WE LOVE WORKING WITH AGENTS TO FIND HOMES IN THE AREA, AND LOOK NO DIFFERENTLY AT SOMEONE WHO OPTS FOR A REAL ESTATE AGENTS VS HOMETOWN HOME BUYERS - WE JUST HOPE PEOPLE SEE THE VALUE IN US OVER A TRADITIONAL SALE!</p><br>
            <h3>Q: IS THERE ANY OBLIGATION WHEN I SUBMIT MY INFO?</h3>
            <p>A: THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO OBLIGATION FOR YOU. ONCE YOU TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOUR PROPERTY - WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THINGS, POSSIBLY SET UP A CALL WITH YOU TO FIND OUT A BIT MORE, AND MAKE YOU AN ALL-CASH OFFER THAT'S BENEFITS BOTH PARTIES. FROM THERE, IT'S 100% YOUR DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU'D LIKE TO SELL YOUR HOUSE TO US. WE WON'T HASSLE OR HARASS YOU, WE WANT YOU TO MAKE THE DECISION OF WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU - NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.</p><br>
